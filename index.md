### CPSC 120

* LAB 5

Lab 5, part 3 was one that I liked because I always wanted to learn how to play blackjack. One challenge was coding the Ace card to change depending if the bonus would BUST the score. Make the Ace use the bonus if the score would not go above 21 if used.

* LAB 6

Lab 6, Part 1 helped us set up for future labs by learning how to make inner and outer loops. Inner and outer loops can help make tasks so much easier. Itâ€™s possible to make a pattern using them.

* LAB 7

Lab 7, Part 1 was the most helpful one for me because it taught me how function worked. Using different files such as a .h file  help separate all the functions from the main function. For lab 1, function were use to find the difference between to give dates.
